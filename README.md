# Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis on various datasets. Each notebook is created using Google Colab, making it easy to run and analyze the code interactively.

## Notebooks

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
   - Description: Demonstrates how to load a dataset into Colab and perform initial exploratory analysis, such as examining data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Description: The notebooks focuses on univariate analysis techniques, including summary statistics, distribution plots, and outlier detection.

3. **Notebook 3: Bivariate Analysis**
   - Description: Explores relationships between two variables using techniques such as scatter plots, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Description: Multivariate analysis techniques, including dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and advanced visualization methods.


5. **Statistical Modeling**
   - Description: Covers statistical modeling techniques, such as regression analysis, classification models, and time series analysis.
